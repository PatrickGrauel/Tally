# Disclaimer

**Read this before using Tally for any aviation-related purpose.**

## Overview

Tally is an independent, hobbyist macOS application licensed under the MIT License. It includes aviation-related calculators and weather lookups intended for situational awareness, study, and personal productivity. **It is not certified, approved, audited, or operationally validated for flight planning, navigation, or the operation of an aircraft.**

The aviation-related features include, without limitation:

- METAR / TAF / ATIS retrieval and display (sourced from third-party providers)
- E6B calculations — wind triangle, density altitude, runway crosswind / headwind component, top-of-descent, fuel
- Weight & balance computations
- Atmospheric model computations

By installing or using Tally — and in particular its aviation features — you understand, acknowledge, and accept the following terms in addition to the MIT License.

## 1. No warranty

Tally is provided **"AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND**, express or implied — including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, completeness, currency, timeliness, non-infringement, or operational suitability for aviation use. The MIT License's warranty disclaimer applies in full.

## 2. Weather and aeronautical data are third-party

METAR, TAF, ATIS, and any other aeronautical data displayed by Tally are retrieved from third-party providers (including but not limited to aviationweather.gov and datis.clowd.io). Tally has **no control** over the accuracy, completeness, latency, or availability of those services. Reports may be:

- **Delayed** beyond their nominal issuance cadence.
- **Cached** locally for several minutes after their original observation or issuance time.
- **Truncated, malformed, or partially decoded** by the upstream provider.
- **Completely unavailable** when the upstream service is offline.
- **Geographically limited** — for example, FAA D-ATIS is only available for FAA-served airports.

Always verify weather and aeronautical information against an **official, regulator-recognized source** (FAA Aviation Weather Center, EUROCONTROL, your national meteorological service, your operator's flight following service, or equivalent) before and during every flight.

## 3. Calculations are generic estimates

E6B, density altitude, fuel-burn, weight & balance, runway-wind, and atmospheric calculations are computed from standard models (ISA / ICAO Standard Atmosphere, generic aerodynamic relationships, simplified fuel-flow assumptions). They **do not** account for your specific aircraft's actual performance, certified envelope, configuration, equipment status, age, mechanical condition, or any operator-specific variation.

**Always cross-check every calculation against your aircraft's Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH), Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM), and / or operator-specific procedures.** Where any difference exists between Tally and the POH/AFM, the POH/AFM governs.

## 4. Not a substitute for official sources

Tally is not a substitute for, and shall not be used in place of:

- Official aviation weather products (FAA Aviation Weather Center, MeteoSwiss, DWD, Met Office, AEMET, or your national meteorological service).
- NOTAMs and aeronautical information publications (AIP, supplements, charts, NOTAM briefings).
- Flight planning systems certified for the operation being undertaken (Part 91 vs Part 121/135 in the U.S., NCO vs CAT in the EU, etc.).
- Manufacturer-provided performance data (POH / AFM).
- Aircraft-specific weight & balance worksheets approved by your operator or competent authority.

## 5. Pilot in Command responsibility

The Pilot in Command (PIC) is and remains **solely responsible** for the safe planning, conduct, and termination of the flight — including, without limitation, preflight action, weather assessment, fuel planning, weight & balance, navigation, performance computation, and operational decision-making — per the applicable civil aviation regulations of the operating state, for example:

- **United States:** 14 CFR § 91.3 (Responsibility and authority of the pilot in command), § 91.103 (Preflight action), § 91.13 (Careless or reckless operation), applicable Part 121 / 125 / 135 supplements.
- **European Union:** Commission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 (Air OPS), Annexes Part-NCO / Part-NCC / Part-CAT, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 923/2012 (SERA), Part-FCL.
- Or the equivalent regulations of the operating state.

Use of Tally **does not relieve the PIC of any regulatory, operational, or moral obligation.**

## 6. No liability

In no event shall the authors, contributors, copyright holders, or distributors of Tally be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages — including, without limitation, loss of life, personal injury, bodily harm, property damage, loss of an aircraft, loss of cargo, regulatory action, loss of license, loss of revenue, or loss of business — arising from, related to, or in connection with the use of, or the inability to use, this software, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other legal theory, even if the authors or contributors have been advised of the possibility of such damages, and even if the damages are alleged to be caused by a defect in this software.

If applicable law does not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain liabilities, the foregoing limitations apply to the maximum extent permitted by such law.

## 7. Non-aviation features

For Tally's non-aviation features (general calculator, unit conversion, currency conversion, timezone math, finance scenarios), the same "AS IS" warranty disclaimer of the MIT License applies. Currency and crypto rates are obtained from third-party providers and may be delayed or incorrect. Finance calculations are illustrative and should not be relied upon as financial, tax, or investment advice.

## 8. Acceptance

**If you are not willing to accept the terms above, do not install or use Tally for any aviation-related purpose.** Installing or using the aviation features of Tally constitutes your acceptance of this disclaimer in addition to the MIT License.
